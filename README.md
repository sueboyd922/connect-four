Just a note for anyone viewing this gorgeous game created by Brad and Susan, the cell and SmartBoard files are not necessary to our game and do not affect it in any way. We had grand ideas for building a smart computer but ultimately abandonned the plan and stuck with our original idea. We prefer playing weaker opponents anyway.
